# vim_config
Contains configuration file for Vim editor.
This repository contains my vim configuration file (Because I'm too lazy to create configuration file for every file I create).
You're free to clone and it and reuse it.
# What this configuration does:
Turns on syntax highlighting, sets line numbers, sets darkblue theme, checks for spelling mistakes in file.
For checking spelling mistakes, do ":WP" (without quotes)

# Paste this Vim configuration file in your home directory as:
.vimrc.
